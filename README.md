### This Mod is currently in development
My girlfriend and I decided to implement some fast food items into minecraft such as burger and bacon.\
All of the textures are handmade by myself, but in the future there will be more designed by my girlfriend. \
We would appreciate if you would give us some feedback on our Discord server.
\
### Current recipes
- Hamburger: Crafting -> Bread - Steak
- Cheeseburger: Crafting -> Bread - Steak - Cheese Slice
- Cheese Wheel: Smelting -> Milk
- Cheese: Crafting -> Cheeswheel
- Cheese Slice: Crafting -> Cheese
- Raw Bacon: Crafting -> Porkchop
- Cooked Bacon: Smelting -> Raw Bacon
\
### Future updates
We will try to implement growable tomatoes and other crops until end of april. Next step is to customize the excessive eating of fast food with status effects like "obesity" (which can be toggled on or of in config), and many other food components. \

If you have an idea on what would fit into the style of this mod feel free to contact us via Discord!
